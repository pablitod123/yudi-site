    - member01.story = "From a young age, my interest in finance stemmed from many afternoons at my grandfather's small coin store. In high school, I interned at a mortgage banking firm and learned about credit and money transactions. While at Yale, I have explored different opportunities to extend my knowledge of finance and investing. I am a member of the Yale Student Investment Group on campus and have analyzed companies and produced pitch ideas for both the Industrial and Technology, Media, and Tele-communication industry groups. I am excited to work together with the rest of the board in making investment education fun and accessible at Yale.";
    - member02.story = "Beyond the experience of developing my own portfolio over the past 3 years, I have an extensive background in chemical physics and cancer therapy research. I believe this background has built a strong work ethic based on critical thinking and logical process. I hope to apply these new found skills to business and finance by creating an educational group on campus aimed at teaching undergrads. My dedicated team of cofounders and I are going to teach new investors how to approach the market without fear and build their own portfolio wisely.";
    - member03.story = "Having enjoyed financial experiences at Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Red Hook Management, I have been able to narrow my financial interests to primarily investment banking, portfolio management, wealth management and investing. My goal in leading YUDI is to spread investment education around campus so that anyone who wants to learn about this topic can have that opportunity. Understanding the financial theory behind investing is important, but at YUDI we are determined to take this theory and turn it into application, so our members can learn not only by listening but, more importantly, by doing.";
    - member04.story = "I am a Yale University sophomore on the baseball team and co-founder of YUDI. I acquired investing experience with a focus in mutual funds while shadowing my father at Poland & Sullivan Insurance and Investments in Delaware. I manage a personal portfolio and I have several virtual portfolios because I enjoy learning about the different types of investments and following market trends. I hope that this group will provide undergraduates (myself included) with an opportunity to broaden their knowledge with respect to the diverse fields of investing.";
    - member05.story = "As a computer science major, I'm most interested in venture capital and quantitative hedge funds. I will be automating recruitment and streamlining information management for one of the largest clubs on campus. I'm looking forward to building business acumen and communication skills applicable to a career in product management.";
    - member06.story = "Maybe he's just the web design guy, but Paul plans to put the skills he gains through working with YUDI team to good use in the future. An Alabama boy and online education geek, Paul's interest range from startups to stock market simulators, and he's looking forward to helping YUDI develop its curriculum and outreach through soon-to-be-started projects of his own.";
    - member07.story = "A member of Yale's Class of 2017, I come from strong background in research, having previously worked Microsoft Research New England and a biomedical engineering lab at Northwestern University. I have always enjoyed mathematics and analysis, and have specialized in the former at Yale, taking courses ranging from linear algebra to network theory. I'm particularly interested in the application of network theory to economics and finance, and excited about YUDI's mission to educate the undergraduate community about investing.";
    - member08.story = "As a junior economics major at Yale, I'm most interested in the practical applications of economic theory as it relates to investing and our financial systems. I first began to explore my interests in finance during my freshman year at Yale &ndash; studying different valuation methodologies, accounting principles, etc. I am truly honored to be a part of this student-run organization that is entirely devoted to the education of common investing and portfolio management techniques. I am hoping to bring my enthusiasm and excitement for finance and investing to YUDI and am looking forward to a wonderful journey as we tackle investing together!";
    - member09.story = "I am a Yale University sophomore and a member of the Women's soccer team. Since I am bicultural, my interest in finance currently centers on foreign markets. I hope to learn more about investment and am glad that I am in a position to bring this helpful information to other interested students. I really enjoy working with the YUDI team because everyone is so dedicated, fun and contributing to the success of the group. See you at our next meeting!";
    - member10.story = "As an economics major, my interest for investing and the world of finance has stemmed from the courses I have taken at Yale. My primary field of interest is impact investing, which is a way for individuals to invest their capital to improve their communities while still simultaneously earning returns that meet their financial objectives. I hope to be an impact investor in the future, focusing on investments that help public education, and I believe YUDI will enable me and fellow members to be the investors we seek to be by equipping us with the resources and skills.";
