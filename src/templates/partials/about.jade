          p.col-md-12.about__text At YUDI, we want to give everybody the opportunity to learn about finance and investing. Through consistent group meetings, a guest lecture series, and a sponsored stock game competition, we invite the Yale Undergraduate student body to join our journey in learning the essentials of investment analysis. We aim for our members to take away what they&rsquo;ve learned from the meetings and guest lectures and to further apply that knowledge to their own portfolio. We feel that application is the key to success. We look forward to working with you to make finance and investment education accessible and fun on Yale&rsquo;s campus. Welcome to YUDI!
